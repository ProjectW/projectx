It was pretty good. The associates and the MBA interns were super helpful in giving advice on post-college. I learned a lot working with them", actually," as they brought various industry experiences to the job. 	The first 3 weeks are brutal because you have to stay late for planning On Cue", this event Cue Ball holds. Afterwards, direction is a little disorganized, but the associates are super helpful and fun to work with. Pay is not great, but you learn a lot!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3	Karine	Hsu	karinehsu@college.harvard.edu	Cue Ball Capital	Summer Associate	1	7	summer	2014	\N	2014-08-25 17:59:04	2014-08-25 17:59:04	Standard.

He was a great person to talk to and ask for help with work and life advice. One of the other full-time associates, Scott," wasn't directly in charge of the internship program but was also a great resource because he had just graduated from Harvard College and was very relatable.	-I would recommend my internship to someone who wants experience in VC", but not someone who wants a structured internship program. The company only has around 6 full-time people, so it's very much a startup in itself and so there were often times when a lot of the interns were unsure of what to do during the day. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,- The expectations for On Cue really threw me off in the beginning. We had hours from 9AM- 11PM for two weeks doing very meaningless tasks, like creating name tags.

The full-time people were really fun to be around. The other interns were phenomenal, 4 HBS and 3 College, although it did seem like they hired more interns than they really needed. There were some fun company bonding events, like going to Spectacle Island for the day to relax, and Cue Ball really spends extravagant amounts of money on food and wine for lunches and dinners very often. :) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4	test	test	lisawang01@college.harvard.edu	test	test	0	3	summer	2014	\N	2014-08-25 19:18:59	2014-08-25 19:18:59	medium	test	tes	test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5	James	Ho	jamesho@college.harvard.edu	Harvard Management Company	Public Markets Credit Intern	1	2	summer	2014	\N	2014-08-25 23:33:47	2014-08-25 23:33:47	medium	A mix of spreadsheets to help them analyze some trading ideas"," and buildups of the financial statements for companies that they're looking at.	Mentorship is pretty great. You get to meet with the full timers 2-3 times a week for teaching sessions and to ask any of the questions you want. They're also very open to you asking for career advice.	Desk culture is very chill", you have to get in pretty early in the morning but you do around 11 hours a day. As long as you get all your work done you can leave when you want to. You get to learn a ton as long as you're proactive about learning and you show them that you're eager and reliable. Culture and style is more similar to that of a trading desk, where everything is pretty fast paced and trade focused. Really smart people on the desk that have 20+ years of industry experience, so they're essentially experts in the credit markets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"6	Anson	Kahng	ansonkahng@college.harvard.edu	Google	Tech Intern	1	1700	summer	2014	\N	2014-08-26 02:19:30	2014-08-26 02:19:30	Standard. Ya know"," the usual 9-5.	I worked on a data mining project with fleet-wide machine data. Basically an applied machine learning project.	My host was always there when I needed help"," but it was mostly a hands-off mentorship deal.	Amenities are great (gyms", bowling alley, rock climbing wall, meals, snacks, etc.), but you don't get to meet that many other interns over the course of the summer, and sometimes the size of the company serves to make you feel more isolated rather than more included. The experience also really depends on the host (a friend of mine had a rather incompetent host and did not have a good time at all, whereas my host was very competent and helped me immensely), so take host-matching seriously and ask lots of questions in that interview. Also, make sure to take weekends and explore the bay area -- find a good balance between work and fun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7	Sami	Ghoche	samighoche@college.harvard.edu	Palantir Technologies	Infrastructure Engineer	1	200	summer	2014	7000	2014-08-26 09:03:06	2014-08-26 09:03:06	medium	I worked on the Palantir online map product.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I extended a web automation framework then used it to write end to end automated tests and harnesses for the product," and I developped some important features for the map.	Pretty good! I personally didn't have the best mentor (he was a bit awkward) but I absolutely loved my team and you learn just as much from them as you do your mentor. Three weeks in", you're expected to give a one hour talk about the company products," focusing on your area of work.	I absolutely loved it", I would definitely go back (for full time if not for another internship). It's a great company and you're surrounded by very smart and very hardworking people, and the infrastructure team (especially its lead) is awesome. There were a lot of team bonding events, official ones like camping, and very often just drinks at the office and nearby bars. You tend to work more than your typical tech internship I think, but the pay is definitely nice. Great internship!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
